# Human-Pose-Detection

# Overview

This project implements real-time human pose detection using Mediapipe Pose model and OpenCV. The system can : 

1. Detct human body keypoints (eg. shoulders, elbows, knees, etc)

2. Work with live webcam feeds or pre-recorded videos.

3. Save the output video with pose overlays.

This project is designed to run smoothly in Google Colab (pre recorded videos) and local environments (Visual studio code etc).
